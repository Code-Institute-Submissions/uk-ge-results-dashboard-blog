          <p>
            The UK's "first past the post" voting system, means that the candidates with the most votes in their
            constiutency wins the seat in the
            House Of Commons.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Charts 1-3 for the 2019 election results, we can see there are a number of parties with a lower ratio of
            votes to seats and vice versa but most notable are the Scottish National Party having less than half of the
            number of votes than the Liberal Democrats but 4 times the amount of seats and the Democraot Unionist Party
            have just one quater of the amount of Lib Dem votes yet they hold only a few less seats. The Brexit Party,
            having gained an overall 644k votes without a seat comapred to The Alliance Party's 134k votes and 1 seat.
            Again, with only 115k votes the SDLP gained 2 seats while Green gained only 1 with 865K votes. This could
            imply a that those parties with the lower seat to vote ratio may have a larger footprint of supporters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next election may prove to make unusual history if we see these new parties gain traction with their
            campaigning. The pollsters have suggested that the "conservative strength was pointed to
            'leave-supporters'". Election survey data suggested similar turnout by age-group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically we can see in Charts4-5 that not much changed over the past century with the power alternating
            back and forth between Conservative and Labour governments, with difference goimg from one extreme to the
            other in respect of one party's seat gain over the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the period of 2001-2015 there was a much lower turn-out of voters and the elections were between 4
            and 5 years apart. We can only speculate on the reason why.

          <p>Leading up to the 2019 Elections, I found myself worrying about my ignorance on the topic of British
            politics. Having lived as resident abroad for many years, I was likely to waste my first ever vote if I
            didn’t
            do something about it.</p>
          <p>This data visualisation dashboard/blog on the UK General Elections has served to provide me with a better
            understanding of the history and provided me with some answers and insights that the raw data alone could
            not.
          </p>
          <p>I am neither journalist, data scientist or writer; I am a software development student at Code Institute
            and
            so at the same time as all my concerns about which to cast my vote, I had just learned the basics of the
            wonderful ‘d3.js’, ‘dc.js’ and ‘crossfilter.js’ libraries and wanted to experiment with them some more,
            after
            seeing the endless possibilities they provided.</p>
          <p>At the very least, whether by chance or reason, I hope that my visitors enjoy the presentation of data
            but
            I’ll be optimistic that everyone may gain some insights as I have done from being able to discern patterns
            and
            changes in charts.</p>

        <p>
          There are many new politial parties on the block and some could be accused of making a mockery of the space
          governing the country. One cannot help but wonder how Monster Raving Looney Party secured 200% more votes than
          the Animal Welfare Party. In spite of the fact that the oldest standing parties are still winning the power
          struggle, I think
          it begs the question - What is politics coming to?
        </p>
        <p>
          England has the oldest parliament in the world, having met for the first time in the Palace of Westminster,
          or the Houses of Parliament as it's called today, in 1265.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two parties were formed as a result of the constitutional crisis
          between 1678 and 1681, known as the Exclusion Crisis, namely 'Whigs' and 'Tories' and an interesting fact to
          note is that the descendants of these parties formed the coalition government between 2010 and 2015. I
          wonder what they would have had to say?
