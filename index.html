          <h6>In summary...</h6>
          <p>The UK's "first past the post" voting system, means that the parties with the most votes may not win the
            most seats and thus some may say that a "fair" distribution of seats is unlikely in any election, while
            others may debate that since the candidates with the most votes in their constiutency wins a seat in the
            House Of Commons, it is fair on a regional level.</p>
          <p>In Chart 1-3 we can see this clearly where there are a number of parties with a lower ratio of votes
            to seats and vice versa but most notable is the Scottish National Party having less than half of the number
            of votes that the Liberal Democrats but 4 times the amount of seats and the Democraot Unionist Party while
            having a quater of the amount of votes as the Liberal Democrats they hold only a few less seats. The
            Brexit Party, having gained an overall 644k votes without a seat comapred to The Alliance Party's 134k
            votes and 1 seat. Again, with only 115k votes the SDLP gained 2 seats while Green gained only 1 with 865K
            votes. This could imply a much larger footprint for the aforementioned parties.</p>
          <p>The next election may prove to make unusual history if we see these new parties gain traction with their
            campaigning. The pollsters have suggested that the "conservative strength was pointed to
            'leave-supporters'". Electon survey data suggested similar turnout by age-group.</p>
          <p>Historically we can see in Charts4-5 that not much changed over the past century with the power alternating
            back and forth between
            Conservative and Labour governments, with results goimg from one extreme to the other in their differences.
          </p>
          <p>During the period of 2001-2015 there was a much lower turn-out of voters and the elections were between 4
            and 5 years apart.</p>

      <h5 class="text-center><span">Comment from the Author with one raised eyebrow</span></h5>
      <p>There are many new politial parties on the block and some could be accused of making a mockery of the space
        governing the country. One cannot help but wonder how Monster Raving Looney Party secured 200% more votes than
        the Animal Welfare Party. In spite of the fact that the oldest standing parties are still winning the power
        struggle, I think
        it begs the question - What is politics coming to?</p>
      <p>England has the oldest parliament in the world, having met for the first time in the Palace of Westminster,
        or the Houses of Parliament as it's called today, in 1265.</p>
      <p>Two parties were formed as a result of the constitutional crisis
        between 1678 and 1681, known as the Exclusion Crisis, namely 'Whigs' and 'Tories' and an interesting fact to
        note is that the descendants of these parties formed the coalition government between 2010 and 2015. I
        wonder what they would have had to say?
